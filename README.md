### Component Relationships

- **KMS Module**: Creates customer-managed encryption keys in both regions (optional, for future use)
- **S3 Module**: Creates website buckets (primary + failover) and logging bucket, all with AES-256 encryption
- **CloudFront Module**: Creates distribution with OAC, origin groups for failover, and security headers policy
- **DNS Module** (Optional): Creates ACM certificate (us-east-1) and Route 53 records for custom domain

**Note**: Website buckets use S3-managed encryption (SSE-S3/AES-256) rather than KMS encryption due to an AWS limitation: CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) cannot decrypt KMS-encrypted objects because CloudFront makes anonymous requests to S3, and KMS does not support anonymous access.

### Data Flow

1. User requests content via HTTPS
2. CloudFront serves from cache or fetches from primary S3 origin
3. If primary origin returns 5xx errors, CloudFront automatically fails over to secondary origin
4. S3 replication keeps failover bucket synchronized with primary
5. All access is logged to encrypted logging bucket

## Security Model

This module implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers of protection:

### Encryption at Rest

- **S3-Managed Encryption**: All S3 buckets use SSE-S3 (AES-256) encryption
- **CloudFront OAC Compatibility**: Website buckets use AES-256 instead of KMS due to AWS limitation - CloudFront OAC cannot decrypt KMS-encrypted objects because CloudFront makes anonymous requests to S3, and KMS does not support anonymous access
- **Automatic Encryption**: All objects are automatically encrypted at rest using AES-256 algorithm
- **No Additional Cost**: S3-managed encryption has no additional cost compared to KMS

### Encryption in Transit

- **HTTPS Only**: CloudFront enforces HTTPS for all viewer connections
- **TLS 1.2 Minimum**: Modern TLS protocol version required
- **Certificate Management**: ACM certificates with automatic renewal (when using custom domains)

### Access Control

- **Private S3 Buckets**: All buckets have Block Public Access enabled
- **Origin Access Control (OAC)**: CloudFront uses OAC (not legacy OAI) to access S3
- **Bucket Policies**: S3 bucket policies restrict access exclusively to CloudFront distribution
- **No Public ACLs**: Public ACLs are blocked on all buckets

### Security Headers

When `enable_security_headers = true` (default), CloudFront adds the following headers to all responses:

- **Strict-Transport-Security**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff`
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY`
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block`
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **Content-Security-Policy**: `default-src 'self'`

### High Availability

- **Multi-Region**: S3 buckets in two configurable AWS regions
- **Automatic Failover**: CloudFront origin groups fail over on 5xx status codes (500, 502, 503, 504)
- **Cross-Region Replication**: S3 replication ensures data availability in both regions
- **Versioning**: S3 versioning enabled on website buckets for replication

### Encryption Implementation

All S3 buckets use S3-managed encryption (SSE-S3) with AES-256:

1. **Primary Website Bucket**: Encrypted with AES-256
2. **Failover Website Bucket**: Encrypted with AES-256
3. **Logging Bucket**: Encrypted with AES-256
4. **Replication**: S3 replication works seamlessly with AES-256 encryption

**Why not KMS?** CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) is incompatible with KMS-encrypted S3 objects. When CloudFront requests objects from S3 using OAC, it makes anonymous requests. KMS requires authenticated requests to decrypt data, making it impossible for CloudFront to access KMS-encrypted objects. This is an AWS platform limitation, not a module limitation.

## Usage

### Basic Example (No Custom Domain)

```hcl
module "static_website" {
  source = "github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-static-website"

  bucket_name             = "my-unique-website-bucket"
  enable_domain           = false
  primary_region          = "us-east-1"
  failover_region         = "us-west-2"
  enable_failover         = true
  enable_replication      = true
  enable_security_headers = true

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}
```

### With Custom Domain

```hcl
module "static_website" {
  source = "github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-static-website"

  bucket_name         = "my-website-bucket"
  enable_domain       = true
  domain_name         = "example.com"
  create_route53_zone = true

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
```

### Custom Regions (EU)

```hcl
module "static_website" {
  source = "github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-static-website"

  bucket_name     = "my-eu-website-bucket"
  primary_region  = "eu-west-1"
  failover_region = "eu-central-1"
  enable_domain   = false

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Region      = "EU"
  }
}
```

### Single Region (Failover Disabled)

```hcl
module "static_website" {
  source = "github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-static-website"

  bucket_name        = "my-website-bucket"
  enable_failover    = false
  enable_replication = false
  enable_domain      = false

  tags = {
    Environment = "development"
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.5.0
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- AWS account with necessary IAM permissions (see below)

### Steps

1. **Create a Terraform configuration**:

```hcl
# main.tf
module "static_website" {
  source = "github.com/your-org/terraform-aws-static-website"

  bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

output "website_url" {
  value = "https://${module.static_website.cloudfront_domain_name}"
}
```

2. **Initialize Terraform**:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. **Review the plan**:

```bash
terraform plan
```

4. **Apply the configuration**:

```bash
terraform apply
```

5. **Upload your website content**:

```bash
aws s3 sync ./website-content s3://$(terraform output -raw website_bucket_name)/
```

6. **Access your website**:

```bash
echo "Website URL: https://$(terraform output -raw cloudfront_domain_name)"
```

### Updating Content

After uploading new content, invalidate the CloudFront cache:

```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id $(terraform output -raw cloudfront_distribution_id) \
  --paths "/*"
```

## Important: CloudFront OAC and KMS Encryption Incompatibility

### Why This Module Uses AES-256 Instead of KMS

This module uses S3-managed encryption (SSE-S3/AES-256) for website buckets instead of customer-managed KMS keys due to an AWS platform limitation:

**The Issue**: CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) cannot access KMS-encrypted S3 objects.

**Why**: When CloudFront uses OAC to fetch objects from S3, it makes **anonymous requests** to S3. KMS requires **authenticated requests** with proper IAM permissions to decrypt data. Since CloudFront's requests are anonymous (by design of OAC), KMS cannot decrypt the objects, resulting in 403 Forbidden errors.

**The Solution**: Use S3-managed encryption (SSE-S3) with AES-256 algorithm. This provides:

- Encryption at rest for all objects
- No additional cost (included with S3)
- Full compatibility with CloudFront OAC
- Automatic encryption for all new objects

**Security Note**: While AES-256 doesn't provide the same level of key management control as KMS (you can't rotate keys on your schedule or use custom key policies), it still provides strong encryption at rest using the AES-256 algorithm, which is the same encryption algorithm used by KMS.

**If You Need KMS**: If your compliance requirements mandate customer-managed keys, you would need to use CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI, the legacy method) instead of OAC, or use a different architecture such as Lambda@Edge to handle decryption. However, OAC is the recommended approach by AWS for new deployments.

### Migrating from KMS to AES-256

If you previously deployed this module with KMS encryption, note that:

1. Changing bucket encryption settings only affects **new objects**
2. Existing objects retain their original encryption
3. You must re-upload objects to apply the new encryption:

```bash
# Re-upload all objects
aws s3 sync ./website-content s3://your-bucket-name/ --delete

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DIST_ID --paths "/*"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Direct S3 Access Returns 403

This is expected behavior. S3 buckets are private and can only be accessed through CloudFront. To verify:

```bash
# This should fail (403 Forbidden)
curl https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

# This should succeed
curl https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/index.html
```

### CloudFront Returns 403

Check that:

1. The S3 bucket policy allows access from CloudFront OAC
2. The CloudFront distribution is using the correct OAC
3. Objects exist in the S3 bucket

```bash
# List objects in bucket
aws s3 ls s3://$(terraform output -raw website_bucket_name)/

# Check CloudFront distribution status
aws cloudfront get-distribution \
  --id $(terraform output -raw cloudfront_distribution_id) \
  --query 'Distribution.Status'
```

### Replication Not Working

Verify:

1. Versioning is enabled on both buckets
2. IAM role has correct permissions
3. Objects are being created in the primary bucket

```bash
# Check replication status
aws s3api get-bucket-replication \
  --bucket $(terraform output -raw website_bucket_name)
```

### Objects Encrypted with Wrong Algorithm

If you previously deployed with KMS encryption and switched to AES-256, existing objects retain their original encryption. You must re-upload objects for them to use the new encryption setting:

```bash
# Re-upload objects to apply new encryption
aws s3 sync ./website-content s3://$(terraform output -raw website_bucket_name)/ --delete

# Or copy in-place to re-encrypt
aws s3 cp s3://bucket/file.html s3://bucket/file.html --metadata-directive REPLACE
```

### Cache Invalidation

To clear CloudFront cache after updating content:

```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id $(terraform output -raw cloudfront_distribution_id) \
  --paths "/*"
```

## Lessons Learned

### S3 Bucket Encryption Settings Are Not Retroactive

When you change an S3 bucket's default encryption settings, the change only applies to **new objects** uploaded after the change. Existing objects retain their original encryption method. This means:

- If you change from KMS to AES-256, existing objects stay KMS-encrypted
- If you change from AES-256 to KMS, existing objects stay AES-256-encrypted
- To re-encrypt existing objects, you must re-upload them or use S3 copy-in-place

**Example**:

```bash
# Copy in-place to re-encrypt with new bucket default
aws s3 cp s3://bucket/file.html s3://bucket/file.html --metadata-directive REPLACE
```

### KMS Key Deletion Makes Data Permanently Inaccessible

If you delete a KMS key, **all data encrypted with that key becomes permanently unrecoverable**, including:

- All versions of versioned objects
- All objects in all buckets encrypted with that key
- No recovery is possible after the deletion waiting period expires

**Best Practices**:

- Never delete KMS keys unless absolutely certain no data needs to be accessed
- Disable keys instead of deleting them
- Use the maximum waiting period (30 days) to allow for recovery
- Monitor for errors after disabling a key before considering deletion

### CloudFront OAC and KMS Are Incompatible

CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) cannot access KMS-encrypted S3 objects because:

1. CloudFront makes anonymous requests to S3 when using OAC
2. KMS requires authenticated requests with IAM permissions to decrypt data
3. Anonymous requests cannot be authenticated for KMS decryption

This is an AWS platform limitation, not a bug. The solution is to use S3-managed encryption (SSE-S3/AES-256) for objects accessed via CloudFront OAC.
