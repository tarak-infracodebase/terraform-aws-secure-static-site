According to AWS, serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. The cloud provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run your code.  In simple terms, you write the function, and the cloud runs it.  For security engineers, this is a breakthrough. It means you can automate security actions quickly, cost-effectively, and reliably which are all triggered by real-time events.  Orchestration, on the other hand, coordinates multiple serverless functions or workflows into a single automated process. Think of it as a conductor managing a symphony of security automation.  Together, serverless and orchestration enable event-driven, continuous, and scalable security.  ملاحظة Serverless automation turns detection into action, thus reducing response time from hours to seconds.

According to AWS, cloud security is “the highest priority at AWS&quot; and consists of a shared responsibility model between the provider and the customer. However, Cloud Security Development takes that a step further. It focuses on engineering and building the services, tools, and automations that secure cloud environments.  This involves developing custom logic and controls through APIs and SDKs, automating guardrails, and enforcing best practices at scale using code. Think of it as the bridge between cloud engineering and security engineering, where you’re not just using the cloud, you’re building the systems that secure it.  In this section, we’ll focus purely on theory and end with a capstone, or a challenge. The goal is to help you understand the key concepts, mental models, and design principles before you start building practical tools later.

With this speed, manual processes are no longer enough to keep systems secure.  Cloud Security Development enables organizations to:  Automate security enforcement: Eliminate repetitive manual steps by embedding logic directly into the cloud’s control plane.Gain real-time visibility: Collect, process, and analyze logs and events to detect changes as they happen.Standardize security: Ensure consistent rules, policies, and tagging across all environments and teams.Accelerate response: Reduce time to detection and remediation during incidents.  By developing custom security capabilities, teams stay proactive rather than reactive. This practice is especially critical for large organizations that manage multiple accounts or projects across AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.  To bring this home, I want you to think about what happens when a misconfigured cloud resource exposes data to the public internet. Without automation and guardrails, this could go unnoticed for weeks, ultimately leading to data loss, compliance violations, and reputational damage.  Here’s what that might look like in terms of risk:  Data Exposure: Sensitive data left accessible due to overly permissive storage configurations.Privilege Escalation: Overly broad IAM permissions granting users or workloads unintended access.Compliance Gaps: Inability to prove continuous enforcement of required controls.Operational Fatigue: Security teams spending hours manually auditing logs or permissions instead of improving controls.

Identity and Access Management (IAM)Every cloud action happens under a principal (a user, role, or service). Understanding least privilege, role assumption, and permission boundaries is key. The most successful cloud security developers automate IAM validations and create small utilities that continuously check for privilege escalation paths or unused permissions. Events and LogsSecurity automation often begins with visibility. Events and logs are your sources of truth for “who did what.&quot; Events represent actions that occur in near real time (e.g., an S3 bucket made public).Logs represent the historical record of all activity (e.g., CloudTrail, Audit Logs, or Activity Logs). These two together allow developers to build detection pipelines and automated responses. Guardrails and PoliciesGuardrails define what “good&quot; looks like. For example, “no unencrypted storage buckets&quot; or “no public subnets in production.&quot; Cloud security developers build these policies into tools, APIs, or Lambda functions that continuously check compliance. Serverless Security FunctionsThe serverless model (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions) is perfect for building lightweight controls. You can listen for specific events and immediately respond without worrying about infrastructure. Data ProtectionEncryption (at rest and in transit), tokenization, and secure key management (via KMS or CMEK) are at the core of protecting data. Cloud security developers ensure these processes are applied consistently and automatically.

This includes using tools to scan your code, fixing the issues within your code, and doing a b$it of threat modeling when designing your application to ensure that you're preventing vulnerabilites from being introduced into your code.  This process really happens within phases within the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), which we'll define and explain in more detail in the next page.

The thing that I want you to understand is that most of this information is stored behind or within some type of application. I am most certain that you log into a web application to pay your bills or view what's your bank account right? So imagine if that application that you using to view that data and pay those bills is vulnerable. At this point, there is a way for someone to compromise the system, potentially your sensitive information and possibly someone elses, and then use that against you or/and sell it on the dark web.  So, to help bring this home, I want you to understand that applications are often targeted by attackers looking to exploit vulnerabilities for unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious purposes. If an application is poorly structured, threat modeled, or secured, here are some of the underlying impacts and affects:  Data breaches: Loss or exposure of sensitive data.Compliance violations: Non-compliance with industry regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.Reputational damage: Loss of customer trust and market position.

However, I've taken the liberty of listing out some of the most common vulnerabilites that I&quot;ve experienced that are still pretty impactful that you should know:  SQL Injection: Malicious input allows attackers to manipulate queries to a database, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially affecting other users.Insecure Authentication and Authorization: Weak or improperly configured access controls can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data.Sensitive Data Exposure: Inadequate protection of sensitive information, such as encryption or tokenization, can lead to data breaches.

These techniques play an essential role in identifying vulnerabilities within your code or your running application.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a white-box testing technique that analyzes the application's source code, bytecode, or compiled binaries for vulnerabilities. White-box testing refers to the hacker an understanding of the system prior to testing it for vulnerabilites.  SAST tools scan the code without executing the program, allowing developers to catch potential security issues early in the development process, which is nice. The benefits of SAST are:  Early Detection: Since SAST runs on the source code, it can detect security issues during development, even before the code is compiled or deployed.Comprehensive Coverage: SAST can analyze all code paths and uncover vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows, and insecure coding practices.Automated: SAST tools can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, automatically analyzing code upon each commit or build.  On the other hand, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a black-box testing technique that examines the application's running state by simulating real-world attacks. Black-box testing refers to the tester not having any knowledge about the application or product, which is what most pentesters or hackers do anyway.  DAST tools test applications in their operational environments (e.g., web apps, APIs) to find vulnerabilities that may only become apparent during runtime, which can give you a very accurate assessment of what is truly components of your app is truly vulnerable. Here are some of the benefits of DAST:  Runtime Detection: Since DAST tests a running application, it can catch vulnerabilities like misconfigurations, authentication issues, and other flaws that arise when the application is in use.No Access to Source Code: DAST doesn’t need access to the application’s code, making it effective for identifying vulnerabilities in third-party applications and APIs.Real-World Simulation: DAST mimics the behavior of a real-world attacker, identifying potential attack vectors from an external perspective.  While SAST focuses on finding vulnerabilities in the code itself, DAST assesses how the application performs once deployed. Together, they provide a comprehensive approach to security testing:  SAST: Ideal for early-stage detection, scanning static code and catching issues before the application is deployed.DAST: Crucial for identifying vulnerabilities that can only be found in the operational environment, such as misconfigurations or runtime-specific issues.  By incorporating both SAST and DAST into the SDLC, you ensure that security testing occurs at both the code level and the operational level, minimizing the risk of vulnerabilities slipping through the cracks.

It's an approach to culture, automation, and platform design that integrates security as a shared responsibility throughout the entire IT lifecycle.  What makes DevSecOps powerful is that it takes the principles of DevOps and extends them by embedding security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The ultimate goal is to shift security left, meaning security activities happen earlier in the process. This ensures vulnerabilities are identified and fixed before they can become critical issues.    ملاحظة You can find the original image source here: Atlassian | DevSecOps Tools  Over time, DevSecOps has evolved from the limitations of traditional DevOps, where security was often treated as an afterthought.

To keep it short, the SDLC consists of six key phases:  Planning and Requirements Gathering: Understanding what the software needs to do and ensuring it aligns with business requirements.Design: Architecting the solution to meet functional and non-functional requirements.Development: Writing the actual code... or programming.Testing: Ensuring that the software works as intended and is free from bugs (that don't impact the features).Deployment: Releasing the software into higher environments (QA, Production)Maintenance: Ongoing updates/enhancements and fixes post-release  The downside to this process is that there is no security baked into any of phases. Formally known as the traditional SDLC, when developers follow this model, security is often treated as an afterthought and addressed after the deployment phase and well into the maintenance phase (and I do mean well into the maintanence phase). This reactive approach can result in security issues being discovered late, which can be quite costly and disruptive to fix overtime. So, when you're developing applications of any kind, pretty pretty please keep this in mind.

The Secure SDLC (SSDLC) is an evolution of the traditional SDLC model, where security is a key consideration at every phase of the process. Rather than treating security as a final step, it becomes an significant part of each phase by helping to reduce vulnerabilities and risks earlier in the lifecycle. So, when you the term &quot;shift-left&quot; or &quot;shifting-left&quot;, I want you think about the SSDLC, because that's essentially what we're doing. We are moving security from the end of the SDLC and integrating it into every phase within the SDLC.  One of the key benefits of the SSDLC is that you are finding and figuring out any security issues as you iterate through the Secure SDLC, which overtime helps save cost and eliminates the overhead and potential of releasing vulnerabilities into the wild.    ملاحظة You can find the original image source here: Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) | Snyk  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Key Phases of the Secure SDLC​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is the Secure SDLC?","url":"/ar/blueprint/devsecops/what-is-the-secure-sdlc-and-sdlc#key-phases-of-the-secure-sdlc","content":" There are 6 key phases that you should know:  Planning and Requirements Gathering (with Security in Mind) At this phase, it’s crucial to gather both functional and security requirements. By considering security from the outset, you ensure that the software design accounts for potential threats and compliance with security standards such as GDPR, HIPPA, etc. Some example security activities that you should be aware of that happens at this phase include: Threat modeling (very... very... important)Conducting risk assessmentsComplaince mapping Design (Secure Architecture) During the design phase, architectural decisions should be made with security as a priority. This involves creating a robust design that can mitigate common security threats, which is SUPER important. Starting off with security in the design ensures that the developers code securely. Some example security activities that you should be aware of that happens at this phase include: Identifying security design patternsDefining security controlsIdentifying attack vectors and ways to mitigate them. Development (Secure Coding Practices) This is my favorite phase, because this is where the magic happens. However, you don't really get anywhere without coding securely. Secure coding is the first line of defense for your application. You're literally ensuring that you are preventing vulnerabilites by coding in secure manner and following best practices for preventing things like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The best practices will differ based on the language that you're coding in, but the concept itself is transferable. Some example security activities that you should be aware of that happens at this phase include: Performing code reviews and pair programmingExecuting static application security testing (SAST) scansChecking your dependencies for vulnerabilities by running dependency scans against them. Testing (Security Testing) Okay... this is my second favorite phase because you can to see if what you built truly works and is secured properly by performing automated and manual security tests. To add context, automated and manual security testing should be embedded in this phase to catch vulnerabilities early. Instead of relying solely on traditional testing, specific security tests like penetration testing and dynamic analysis are key. This can be achieved by: Performing or implementing Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scanningConducting penetration tests,Finding and using fuzz testing tools. Deployment (Secure Configuration and Monitoring) In this phase, security continues during deployment by ensuring that applications are deployed securely. This includes using secure configurations, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security, and container security practices. Some example security activities that you should be aware of that happens at this phase include: The reviewal of deployment configurations to ensure that they adhere to best practicesContainer hardening and scanningEnsuring least privilege access controls for your application or infrastructure. Maintenance (Continuous Security and Monitoring) After deployment, the application enters the maintenance phase, where it’s essential to continue monitoring for new vulnerabilities and regularly apply patches or updates. If you did everything correctly the first time, your application should be pretty secure. From a security standpoint though, some common activities that happen in this phase that you should be aware of is: Implementing continous monitoring solutions and processesCreating patch management processesDeveloping and implementing an incident response plan (security and operations).

Organization: DSB This should match the name of your Terraform Cloud organization. It restricts access to only runs that originate from this specific org. Project Name: AWS If you're using Terraform Cloud projects, this narrows the access scope to a particular project. You can update this to match the exact name you're using, or leave it open-ended depending on your structure. Workspace Name: * Using an asterisk allows any workspace within the specified organization and project to assume the role. If you prefer to scope this more tightly, you can replace the * with a specific workspace name. Run Phase: * This allows the role to be assumed during any phase of a run (plan, apply, etc). You can scope this more tightly if needed, but * is most flexible during development. 💡 These trust conditions form the basis of your IAM role’s assume role policy. It ensures that only authorized Terraform runs from specific contexts can use this role to deploy resources into AWS.
